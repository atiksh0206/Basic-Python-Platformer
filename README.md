# Basic-Python-Platformer
Hello, this is my first ever project. I will be following a tutorial created by the youtube channel, freeCodeCamp.org. I will be learning how to create a platformer game. Throughout this project, I will be pushing updates to Github as I work on this. Ideally, I will eventually expand on this and create my own game with some unique features.
